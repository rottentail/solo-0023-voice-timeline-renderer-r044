# Voice Timeline Renderer

Voice Timeline Renderer is a self-hosted Go service for turning validated PCM
WAV recordings into a crossfaded, peak-normalized mixdown. The service exposes
an idempotent HTTP surface, keeps media and metadata under one data directory,
and records every render transition.

The implementation covers:

- 16-bit integer PCM WAV validation and signal measurement.
- Ordered timeline spans with source-frame selection, gain, and crossfade.
- Linear sample-rate conversion and mono/stereo channel mapping.
- Equal-power neighboring-span crossfades.
- Peak normalization into a requested dBFS target.
- Durable render states, receipts, and atomically committed output folders.

Automated tests are intentionally deferred. A later task stage will add unit,
integration, and end-to-end verification around the production interfaces.

## Requirements

- Go 1.23 or newer.
- A writable local directory for source media, timeline metadata, render jobs,
  output WAV files, and receipts.

No network service, database server, or third-party Go module is required.

## Build

```bash
go build ./...
```

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/voiceservice \
  -addr :8093 \
  -data ./var/voice-timeline
```

The health endpoint is `GET http://127.0.0.1:8093/healthz`.

Runtime settings are supplied through arguments:

- `-addr`: HTTP listen address, default `:8093`.
- `-data`: persistent data root, default `./var/voice-timeline`.

No environment variable is required. Do not put credentials in the repository;
the service does not consume any remote credential.

## HTTP interface

### Register a source

`PUT /v1/sources/{source_id}`

```json
{
  "name": "opening take",
  "wav_base64": "UklGR..."
}
```

The source ID is chosen by the caller and must be 3-64 characters using
letters, digits, underscore, or hyphen. Repeating the same ID with exactly the
same name and bytes is idempotent. Reusing it with different content returns
the `source_conflict` error.

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "opening_take_01",
  "name": "opening take",
  "digest": "b7c0...",
  "byte_count": 96044,
  "sample_rate": 48000,
  "channels": 1,
  "bits_per_sample": 16,
  "frame_count": 48000,
  "duration_ms": 1000,
  "peak_dbfs": -8.0,
  "rms_dbfs": -11.0,
  "created_at": "2026-11-09T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Compose a timeline

`PUT /v1/timelines/{timeline_id}`

```json
{
  "name": "two part narration",
  "sample_rate": 48000,
  "output_channels": 2,
  "target_peak_dbfs": -1,
  "spans": [
    {
      "source_id": "opening_take_01",
      "source_start_frame": 0,
      "source_end_frame": 48000,
      "gain_db": -2,
      "crossfade_frames": 0
    },
    {
      "source_id": "closing_take_01",
      "source_start_frame": 0,
      "source_end_frame": 44100,
      "gain_db": 0,
      "crossfade_frames": 4800
    }
  ]
}
```

Spans are sequential. A later span overlaps its predecessor by
`crossfade_frames`; the overlap is mixed with equal-power weights. A crossfade
must fit within both neighboring spans.

### Start a render

`PUT /v1/renders/{render_id}`

```json
{
  "timeline_id": "two_part_narration_01"
}
```

The render runs through the durable states
`queued -> rendering -> finalizing -> completed`. A failed render records a
terminal `failed` state with a stable error code and does not expose a partial
output folder.

### Recover interrupted renders

A render job is durable, so an interrupted process can leave one behind in an
active state. Recovery is built into both entry points and always keeps the
original render identifier:

- At startup the service resumes every non-terminal job before it accepts
  requests.
- Repeating `PUT /v1/renders/{render_id}` for a non-terminal job resumes it
  instead of replaying the stale record.

Resumption first inspects the committed artifact folder. When the receipt
names this render and timeline and the output bytes match the receipt digest,
the artifacts are adopted and the job is marked completed without re-mixing.
Files that cannot prove they belong to the job are moved to a quarantine
folder under `tmp/` and the job is executed again. Every resumption ends in an
explainable terminal state: `completed`, or `failed` with the stable error
code that caused it.

Publishing is single-writer: an executor lease (`jobs/<render_id>.lock`)
ensures that recovery and a concurrent same-identifier request cannot publish
at the same time. A request that arrives while another executor holds the
lease receives the current job state and can poll until it turns terminal.
Leases expire and are reclaimed atomically, so a crashed executor cannot
block a render forever.

### Read resources

- `GET /v1/sources/{source_id}`
- `GET /v1/timelines/{timeline_id}`
- `GET /v1/renders/{render_id}`
- `GET /v1/renders/{render_id}/receipt`
- `GET /v1/renders/{render_id}/output`

The output route returns `audio/wav`. The receipt records source digests, span
placement, channel mapping, measured peak and RMS amplitude, normalization
gain, output digest, and non-fatal warnings.

## Data directory

```text
var/voice-timeline/
  sources/<source_id>/
    source.wav
    metadata.json
  timelines/<timeline_id>.json
  jobs/<render_id>.json
  jobs/<render_id>.lock
  renders/<render_id>/
    output.wav
    receipt.json
  tmp/
```

Source and render folders are assembled in `tmp/` and moved into place with one
directory rename. Metadata updates use same-directory temporary files followed
by rename. The job lock file is the executor lease described above; it is
removed when the job turns terminal. Render artifact folders that fail
ownership verification are quarantined under `tmp/quarantine-*`, and leftover
staging folders are cleaned during startup recovery.

## Source layout

```text
cmd/voiceservice/       service entry point
cmd/timelinecheck/      workflow execution entry point
internal/httpapi/       routing, request limits, JSON errors, media response
internal/service/       workflow orchestration and idempotency
internal/domain/        entities, validation, errors, and render transitions
internal/audiocodec/    WAV handling, transforms, and signal measurement
internal/render/        timeline preparation, mixing, normalization, receipt
internal/storage/       atomic local repository
internal/checkflow/     bounded production workflow checks
```

## Workflow checks

Run each declared production check from the repository root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/timelinecheck -workflow ingest-audio-source
go run ./cmd/timelinecheck -workflow compose-timeline
go run ./cmd/timelinecheck -workflow render-mixdown
go run ./cmd/timelinecheck -workflow recover-interrupted-render
```

Each check creates an isolated temporary data directory, starts the real HTTP
handler, sends generated WAV inputs, and verifies read-back or rendered
output. The recovery check additionally restarts the service stack over the
same data directory to confirm interrupted renders reach a terminal state.
The checks are bounded and do not require network access.

## Deferred test boundary

This baseline contains no unit tests, test fixtures, browser checks, or
`test_command`. The downstream task stage owns test creation and red/green
verification. It should extend coverage around WAV chunk edge cases, timeline
crossfade bounds, failed job cleanup, concurrent idempotency, and HTTP error
mapping.
